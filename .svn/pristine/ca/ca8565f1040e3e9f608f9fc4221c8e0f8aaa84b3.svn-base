/**
 * In computer science, a stream is a sequence of data elements made available
 * over time. A stream can be thought of as items on a conveyer belt being
 * processed one at a time rather than in large batches.
 *
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_(computing)
 *
 * The string stream class (shortened to sstream) is a container that
 * implements a stream of characters, as well as some other features not
 * normally associated with a generic stream.
 *
 * The sstream stores an underlying buffer of characters and maintains a
 * "position" within this buffer. As characters are read from the stream,
 * the position of the stream advances forward by the number of characters
 * successfully read. Thus, multiple reads from the stream will generally
 * return different outputs. This position shall be exposed to and may be
 * modified by the user.
 *
 * The user may push additional sequences of characters to the sstream. By
 * default, these new characters shall be pushed to the end of the underlying
 * buffer without modifying the sstream's position.
 *
 *
 * Note that, whenever a C-string is added to the string stream, the null byte
 * in that C-string is NOT considered to be added to the stream.

 * several '\0' (null) bytes. C-strings cannot contain multiple null bytes by
 * definition, since the first null byte delimits the end of a C-string.
 *
 * However, to maintain compatibility with C standard library functions such
 * as printf(), every bytestring produced by sstream methods shall contain an
 * extra null byte '\0' at the very end of its buffer, which does NOT
 * contribute to its size. bytestrings passed into sstream methods cannot
 * be expected to abide by this rule however, unless the `size` member is
 * negative.
 *
 * By convention, if the `size` of a bytestring passed into sstream methods is
 * negative, it indicates that `str` is a C-string whose length can be
 * calculated by finding the position of its null byte.
